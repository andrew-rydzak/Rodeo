    'Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin \
    literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College \
    in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and \
    going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. \
    Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) \
    by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. \
    The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. \
    The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. \
    Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their \
    exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham..',
